## Problem Statement
*   **Information Gap:** Access to timely, understandable, and actionable environmental health data is a critical global challenge. Public health organizations and communities often struggle to link complex environmental factors (like pollution, climate, and geography) to specific, localized health risks.
*   **Reactive Healthcare:** This information gap fosters reactive healthcare systems that are forced to treat diseases *after* outbreaks occur, rather than preventing them in the first place.
*   **Lack of Empowerment:** Individuals and communities lack the tools to easily assess the potential health hazards in their immediate surroundings, preventing them from taking proactive, protective measures.
*   **The Need:** There is a pressing need for a tool that democratizes environmental intelligence, translating complex data into clear insights that empower proactive health decisions.

## Overview of Our Solution
OJAS is a cutting-edge web application that bridges the gap between environmental data and public health. It operates on a sophisticated, multi-layered architecture powered by **Google's Gemini AI models** and a modern **React/TypeScript** frontend.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:

*   **AI Core Engine (Gemini API):**
    *   **Text & Multimodal Analysis:** We use the `gemini-2.5-flash` model as the primary engine for all analytical tasks. By enforcing a strict JSON output schema, we ensure that the AI's responses are consistently structured, reliable, and ready to be displayed in the UI.
    *   **Image Generation:** The `imagen-3.0-generate-002` model is leveraged to create realistic, satellite-style images for location analyses, providing immediate visual context to the data.

*   **User Interaction & Features:** The application offers two primary modes of interaction: a public-facing explorer and a feature-rich dashboard for authenticated users.

    1.  **Public Globe Explorer:**
        *   Users can visually explore a 3D globe and select any point on Earth for analysis.
        *   A `gemini-2.5-flash` prompt is generated with the precise coordinates, requesting an analysis of local geography and climate to identify potential health hazards (e.g., stagnant water, pollution indicators) and associated disease risks (e.g., Malaria, Dengue).
        *   Simultaneously, `imagen-3.0-generate-002` generates a visual representation of the selected location.
        *   The results are presented in a clear, actionable intelligence briefing.

    2.  **Authenticated User Dashboard:** After a secure login, users gain access to a suite of personalized health tools:
        *   **Environmental Image Analysis:** Users upload a photo of their surroundings. `gemini-2.5-flash` performs a multimodal analysis on the image content to identify and report on visible health hazards.
        *   **Prescription Analysis:** The AI performs OCR on an uploaded prescription image, interpreting handwriting and text to extract medicine names, dosages, and instructions into a simple summary.
        *   **Symptom Checker & Mental Wellness:** For these features, user input (text descriptions or questionnaire answers) is sent to `gemini-2.5-flash` with carefully crafted prompts that guide the AI to provide cautious, informational, and supportive feedback, always with a disclaimer to consult a professional.
        *   **AI Health Assistant:** A streaming chatbot provides real-time, conversational answers to health-related questions, enhancing user engagement and support.

*   **Data & Services:**
    *   **Location Intelligence:** The application uses Gemini for highly accurate geocoding (turning a search query like "Eiffel Tower" into coordinates) and for finding nearby medical facilities based on a given coordinate pair.
    *   **User Data:** User authentication is handled locally within the browser using `localStorage`. This is a simplified system for demonstration purposes. Activity history is also stored locally.

This combination of a highly interactive frontend and a powerful, versatile AI backend allows OJAS to deliver on its mission: transforming complex environmental data into accessible and actionable public health intelligence.
